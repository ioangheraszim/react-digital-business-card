## Built with

## What I learned

I have gained proficiency in working with React, including creating components and effectively utilizing them within my projects. Additionally, I have developed a strong understanding of applying styles to React components, allowing me to enhance their visual appeal and create visually engaging user interfaces.

### Continued development
In my future project, I'll use React and the skills learned in this tutorial to build an AirBnB mini clone. Utilizing React's capabilities, I aim to create an interactive and visually appealing card that showcases my professional information. By implementing components, adding styles, and ensuring a seamless user experience, I'll develop a AirBnB mini clone using data driven react instead of static hard coded data.
